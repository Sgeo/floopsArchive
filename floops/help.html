Do you have a <A HREF="http://cosmo.sgi.com" target="_top">
VRML 2.0 browser</A> plug-in? And which version? Whichever VRML browser you
are using, make sure it's the latest version, make sure it supports VRML 2.0 
(which is what allows for the cool animation and sound) and also that your Web 
browser
is current. These leading edge technologies are still in the "high
maintenance" stage, sorry. (Though if we can help it, that will change
ASAP).<P>
 After you've made sure you have a a current browser and plug-in,
reload the page. It seems simple, and it is, and sometimes modern
technology just doesn't have answers for why something works one time
and not another. 
<P>
If it still doesn't work, and you still get a blank
screen when you should be seeing our little Floops, try giving more
memory to your Web browser by closing other applications. Also try 
restarting the browser and emptying the cache. 
If it still doesn't work, uninstall your VRML
browser and install a new version. Of course we know the Cosmo Player
browser works with Internet Explorer and Netscape 3.0 (it's what I use everyday), so if you
haven't tried <A HREF="../CosmoPlayer/index.html" target="_top">
Cosmo,</A> it might be worth your time. 
<P>
And if you STILL need
help, and you are using Cosmo, try posting to the newsgroup
<A HREF="news://cosmo.sgi.com/sgi.cosmoplayer" target="_new">news://cosmo.sgi.com/sgi.comsoplayer</A>
. If you are using another 2.0
browser, you will just have to harass the company that made it. Good
luck!<P>
<CODE><B>It's not animating.</B></CODE><p>
You have to Click on Floops to make him start moving and talking. 
If you click and nothing happens, restart your computer and your
browser, and read the instructions above. It could also be that Floops
just doesn't like you personally and will never work for you no matter
where you are browsing from. Be offended and check back in a week. He's
a bit temperamental - especially if you have a coffee stain on your shirt. Ha,
made you look.<P>

 
<CODE><B>No Sound.</B></CODE><p>
It could be a number of things. (<--- Typical customer support intro.)
The most simple answer is that you didn't wait long enough for the sound
file to download. In fact, the sound file is the biggest part of total
file size, and it downloads <I>after</i> the image has loaded. So it's a good rule  
of thumb to wait a couple extra seconds (or maybe even a minute if you have a slow 
connection) for the entire sound to download before you start
clicking on Floops. 
<P>
The more complex answer could have something to 
do with your sound card, systems configurations, etc. Restarting your computer
 and allotting more memory, as usual, is always a good thing to try. 
If you are running an audio program, like a CD player, 
turn it off and reload the world. 
More specific questions should go to your computer manufacturer customer service.
<P>

<CODE><B>It takes too long to download.</B></CODE><P>
Yup, we agree. But that isn't the fault of VRML, its the heavy sound
files and animation that goes with it (which will change soon enough).
 If you have a slower modem or a slower connection, 
try hitting the site at an off peak time (late night or early morning). 
Also, if you want to show Floops to other people, download the entire VRML
file and save it locally on your machine. That way you can just load a
file, even when you are offline, and view Floops whenever you want to.<P>

<CODE><B>It's something else.</B></CODE><P>
You could try sending email to <A HREF="mailto:editor@vrml.sgi.com">editor@vrml.sgi.com,</A> but most likely 
I won't know *that* much more than I've already said. (Otherwise it
would be here, right?)
You could also check out other VRML information sources and look for experts.
 My first recommendation would be the <A HREF="http://www.sdsc.edu/vrml/" target="_new">
VRML repository</A> at the San Diego Supercomputer Center.
